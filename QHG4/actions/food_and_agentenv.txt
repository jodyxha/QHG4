FoodManager and AgentEnv anf GroupMemberMove
============================================

FoodManager
 - grows food logistically 
 - exports available food in array provided by population
 - takes registrations for food
 - hands out food, reduces food amount in internal food array

AgentEnv
 - counts agents per cell, exports count in array provided by population
 - fills local arrays in m_aEnvVals based on values from FoodManger and agent counts
 - should decrease each agents health by m_dReequirement and kill if 0

GroupMemberMove
 - choose direction based on AgentEnv's local arrays
 - child movements are managed by population´s registerMove: does only adult moves, children must go with their parents
 - later: handle "follow the leader"
