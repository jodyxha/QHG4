In order to easily log in to the server, mount data rives and access the data 
you must make the following settings on your workstation.

User and groups settings
========================
The main user name on your machine should be 'alirv'
  user name: alirv
  user id:   1069
If i remember correctly, you can set this during the installation of ubuntu.
If it is possible to change the login group during installation, set it to 500.

After installation you should create two groups on your machine,
and add the user 'alirv' to them
On a terminal type:
  sudo groupadd -g 500 morpho
  sudo groupadd -g 1111 neander

  sudo usermod -g morpho -G neander alirv
(the option '-g' sets the login group, '-G' sets additinal group memberships)

Networking
==========
Data pertaining to networking1 are usually entered during the installation process.
Make sure that your machine does not use DHCP, but enter the IP address manually:
  IP Address:   130.60.126.113
  Netmask:      255.255.255.128
  Default       130.60.126.1
  nameserver 1: 130.60.128.3
  nameserver 2: 130.60.64.51


NFS
===
NFS (Network FIle System) allows you to mount drives of remote computers.
Most of our data resides on our server aim-bigfoot.uzh.ch (130.60.126.9),
and it is con venient to access it as if it were in a directory on your machine.

To install a NFS client you have to install two packages:
  apt-get install nfs-common 

To import the /morpho directory, you have to create a so-called 'mountpoint'.
Thi is usually an empty directory.
  sudo mkdir /morpho

Then you have to add a line to the file '/etc/fstab'.
Open the file /etc/fstab with a text editor:
  sudo vi /etc/fstab
(the  'sudo' is required, because normal users are not allowed to change system files)
Then add the line
  aim-bigfoot.uzh.ch:/raid1/morpho/  /morpho  nfs   tcp,rw,hard,intr,nosuid,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,nfsvers=3,_netdev     0 0 
 
To mount your home directory from bigfoot:
  sudo mkdir /home/aim-bigfoot
  sudo mkdir /home/aim-bigfoot/alirv
and add the line
  aim-bigfoot.uzh.ch:/raid2/home/alirv  /home/aim-bigfoot/alirv  nfs   tcp,rw,hard,intr,nosuid,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,nfsvers=3,_netdev     0 0 
to
   /etc/fstab
